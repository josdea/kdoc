Title: Making a static version

----

Text: 

When running this code locally you are using Kirby and PHP. One way to use this is to install the code on a server that supports PHP, which would allow you to log into the panel and make edits as needed over the web. Another way, is to work with the site locally and then generate a static non-php version as needed.  This is possible with a script at the root called (link: https://gist.github.com/bastianallgeier/5f182b30d4c90152b468 text: statify.php).

To use this, open the statify.php page in your code editor and modify the url variable to whatever your destination URL will be. 

```
$url = 'http://nsteiner.github.io/kdoc';
```

Then go to */statify.php* in your local site to run the build. The static files will be generated at */static/* at the root.

This is a great way to get your documentation site up on Github's free Pages service. Just open up a branch called *gh-pages* and put the contents of /static/ in it. You can also just FTP the files to just about any web host, since there's no server-side dependencies.
